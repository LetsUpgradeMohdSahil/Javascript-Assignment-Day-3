Q 2. Write the difference between var, let and const with code examples
Ans. var, let and const keywords are used to declare variables in Javascript. While var is the oldest keyword for declaring variables from its inception, let and const are introduced in ES6.
Differences are:

1. Assignment
	let and var can be reassigned to a new value while const cannot be reassigned.
	This makes const the best option for declaring values that do not change in the program, preventing reassignment.
	Example:
		var a = 10;
		a = 20;
		//output: 20
		console.log(a);

		let b = 'hello';
		b = 'world';
		//output: 'world'
		console.log(b);

		const c = 'hello'
		//Error: Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
		c = 'world'

2. Scope
	var is function-scoped.
		Example:
			function func(){
				var funcVar = 'I am function var';
			}

			//output:  Uncaught ReferenceError: funcVar is not defined
			console.log(funcVar);
	
	let and const are block-scoped(any code within {} braces).
		Example:
			{
				let name="Sahil";
			}
			
			//output:  Uncaught ReferenceError: funcVar is not defined
			console.log(name);
