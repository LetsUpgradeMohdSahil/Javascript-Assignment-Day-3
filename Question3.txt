Q 3. Write a brief intro on available data types in Javascript
Ans. JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects and more:
	Below are the Datatype in JavaScript:
1.The String Data Type
	It is used to represent the textual data. It is created using single quotes or double quotes.
		Example: var a = 'Hi there!';  // using single quotes
				var b = "Hi there!";  // using double quotes

2. The Number Data Type
	The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation.
		Example:
		var a = 25;         // integer
		var b = 80.5;       // floating-point number
		var c = 4.25e+6;    // exponential notation, same as 4.25e6 or 425000
		
3. The Boolean Data Type
	The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false.
		Example:
				var isReading = true;   
				var isSleeping = false;
				
4. The Undefined Data Type
	The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.
		Example: 
		var a;
		typeof(a) // Output: undefined
		
5. The Null Data Type
	This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.
		Example:
			var a = null;
			typeof(a); // Output: null
			
6. The Object Data Type
	The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.
		Example:
			var person = {"name": "Clark", "surname": "Kent", "age": "36"};
			typeof(person); //Output: Object
			
7. The Array Data Type
	An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. It store data of same type;
		Example:
			var cities = ["London", "Paris", "New York"];
			typeof(cities) //Output: Array
